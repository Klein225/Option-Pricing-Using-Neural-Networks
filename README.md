# Option-Pricing-Using-Neural-Networks

## Thesis statement:
This is a thesis topic which studies option pricing using (possibly deep) neural networks with outset in McGhee (2018) "An Artificial Neural Network Representation of the SABR Stochastic Volatility Model" and particularly focuses on implementation in Python.

## Folders: 
The following folders will only contain the code used to compute the neural network and its corresponding results. If you would like to read the Thesis, please refer to the PDF.
