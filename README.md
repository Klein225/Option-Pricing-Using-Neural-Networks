# Option-Pricing-Using-Neural-Networks

## Thesis statement:
This is a thesis topic which studies option pricing using (possibly deep) neural networks with outset in McGhee (2018) "An Artificial Neural Network Representation of the SABR Stochastic Volatility Model" and particularly focuses on implementation in Python.

## Folders: 
The following folders will only contain the code used to compute the neural network and its corresponding results. The code has been writtein using Jupyter Notebooks in order for the reader to gain a better overview. If you would like to read the Thesis, please refer to the PDF.

### Black Scholes Merton:
Calculating the simple BSM call/put-prices as well as simulating using Monte Carlo and Artificial Neural Networks. The networks are based on the work by Antoine Savine (https://antoinesavine.com/category/machine-learning/) and William McGhee (An artificial neural network representation of the sabr stochastic volatility model).
